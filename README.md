### 📌 Notes

Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of extensions that can enhance your development experience in various ways. While this boilerplate is specifically tailored for creating `VSCode snippets`, it's important to note that there are several other types of extensions you can develop, such as language support, debugging tools, extension pack and more ... If you're interested in creating a different type of extension, you might need to adjust the template provided in this boilerplate. This could involve changing the `package.json` file, modifying source code to implement the desired functionality, and potentially adding new dependencies or scripts to your project.

> For more information, you can refer to the [VSCode Extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).

### 📌 Usage

To use this template, use the following commands:

```bash
bun create github.com/RajaRakoto/vscode-boilerplate <project-name>
cd <project-name>
bun run pkg-upgrade # to upgrade outdated dependencies in interactive mode
```

> NOTE 2: In order to help you better understand the structure of this boilerplate, there is a `README.md` file in each subdirectory of src.

> NOTE 3: For certain configurations in the `package.json` file, you need to modify them to tailor them to your project (e.g: name, description, author, keywords, main, repository, ...).
