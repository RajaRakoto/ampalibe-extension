**This minimalistic boilerplate is designed to help you quickly start developing extensions for Visual Studio Code. It provides a solid and ready-to-use base structure, allowing you to focus on implementing your unique features without wasting time setting up the development environment.**

**Usage**: You can install it by typing "My extension" in the extension tab of your IDE

Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of extensions that can enhance your development experience in various ways. While this boilerplate is specifically tailored for creating `VSCode snippets`, it's important to note that there are several other types of extensions you can develop, such as language support, debugging tools, extension pack and more ... If you're interested in creating a different type of extension, you might need to adjust the template provided in this boilerplate. This could involve changing the `package.json` file, modifying source code to implement the desired functionality, and potentially adding new dependencies or scripts to your project.
